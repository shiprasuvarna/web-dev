<p style="color:purple;font-size:200%">Practising <strong>HTML</strong> is fun.
 <em>So far</em> we have learned HTML <br> is a language made of tags that help us descibe how we want our web pages to look.
 Very few people know all the tags in <b>HTML</b>, but that is okay beacause we can do a lot with just some basic tags.
 We can learn about new tags when we need them.</p>
